        question: 'What is medical billing?',
        answer: 'Medical billing is collecting and processing claims for different types of healthcare services. It involves tracking patient information such as insurance coverage, deductible amounts, and other details about a patient\'s medical history to ensure that all patients receive appropriate care. Also, a baseline of charges is established for each patient who received care to calculate the amount owed by insurance companies and third parties. Medical billing is a crucial part of the healthcare system, as it ensures that all insurance companies and patients receive their respective share of the cost of treatment.',
